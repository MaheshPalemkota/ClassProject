This weekday party happens at different locations depending on the work load during office hours and famnily situation.
This is not necesasrily happens every week but atleast once or twice in a month.
If any month in a year has public holidays that extends for atlest a week or so, then every pal in the party group happens to become a married bachelor which everyone would like to use this golden oppurtunity
Lets use this sheet to track the weeks utilised in a month.
Can draw metrics at the end of the year to look at utilization of leaves by each pal.
